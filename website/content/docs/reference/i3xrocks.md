    A small intro into what `i3xrocks` is.
---

Since i3 is the underlying tiling manager that is used by regolith, the [`i3blocks`](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) package can also be used. However since the choice was made to use `Xresources` this package has been forked and [`i3xrocks`](https://github.com/regolith-linux/i3xrocks) was born (created by the regolith team).

`i3xrocks` is used to customise the navigation bar as seen in the introductory configuration examples. To find a more thorough guide how to do this go to the [Change Bar Status indicators](/docs/howtos/add-remove-blocklets/)
