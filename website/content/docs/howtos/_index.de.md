## Using the Terminal

This section provides examples of how to change Regolith to suit your needs. Most of them will specify commands to be run in the terminal. If using the terminal is new to you or you'd just like to refresh your memory, [this guide from Ubuntu](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0) is recommended. Another [tutorial from linuxcommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) goes into some more advanced territory.

## i3-wm User Guide

In addition to general command-line abilities, having a basic understanding of what options are available in the [i3 user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) is recommended to get the most out of the interface.
